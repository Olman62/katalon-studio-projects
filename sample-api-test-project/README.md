# API Test Project in Katalon Studio

The project demonstrates how to create an API test project in Katalon Studio and how to write the test cases in the Groovy script. 

The test is done on the basis of data provided by "Free fake API for testing and prototyping" (follow the [link](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)).

The project contains test cases for all the test object types, a test suite, and data classes. The response objects are validated by status code, property value, and class type.
